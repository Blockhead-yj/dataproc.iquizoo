\usage{
conflict(data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Raw data of class \code{data.frame}.}

\item{...}{Other input argument for future expansion.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} contains following values:
\item{nc}{Count of correct responses.}
\item{mrt_inc}{Mean reaction time for incogruent trials.}
\item{mrt_con}{Mean reaction time for congruent trials.}
\item{cong_eff_rt}{Congruency effect of reaction time (RT), i.e., RT
incongruency - RT congruency.}
\item{pc_inc}{Percent of correct for incogruent trials.}
\item{pc_con}{Percent of correct for congruent trials.}
\item{cong_eff_pc}{Congruency effect of percent of correct (PC), i.e., PC
congruency - PC incongruency.}
\item{is_normal}{Checking result whether the data is normal.}
}
\description{
Count of correct responses and congruency effect of correct response and
reaction time are all included. After \code{dataproc.iquizoo} version 0.0.4 (included),
this function will not work and \code{\link[=congeff]{congeff()}} works instead.
