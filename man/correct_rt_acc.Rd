\usage{
correct_rt_acc(
  data,
  crit_rt = 100,
  correct_type = c("both", "rt", "acc", "none"),
  name_rt = "RT",
  name_acc = "ACC"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Raw data of class \code{data.frame}.}

\item{crit_rt}{Minimal reaction time in milliseconds. Reaction times that are
equal or less than this will be treated as illegal.}

\item{correct_type}{Four types are supported. \code{"both"} (default) means that
both response time and accuracy are corrected, \code{"none"} means no
correction, and \code{"rt"}/\code{"acc"} means correct the corresponding one.}

\item{name_rt}{The column name of the \code{data} input whose values are user's reaction time, in which is a \code{numeric} vector.}

\item{name_acc}{The column name of the \code{data} input whose values are user's correctness, in which is a \code{numeric} vector}
}
\value{
The data is added with two new columns. \code{rt_cor}: the corrected
reaction time; \code{acc_cor}: the corrected accuracy. They can both disappear,
because if there is no such correction, the column is added only if the
corresponding variable exists in the original \code{data}.
}
\description{
Generally speaking, a response time that is no more than 100 milliseconds is
impossible for human beings, which is possibly accompanied by an error
operation. This function tried to correct that by setting reaction time to
\code{NA} and accuracy to \code{-1} (can be opted out) for those trials.
